# week5_gym_web_app_project
Creating a piece of software to help a gym mange memberships, and register members for gym activities


The brief required me to make a web app using Ruby, Sinatra and an SQL relational database. 
It allows a user to add, edit and delete gym members, create activities and also book members onto gym activities.
